# MarkingSymbolRecognition
MarkingSymbolRecognition is a deep learning-based module designed to classify marking symbols into three categories: Ticks, Half-Ticks, and Neither. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically extract and classify symbols from PDF documents, contributing to the broader framework of the Mobile Assessment and ANnotation Tool (MAAT).

## Features

  * Automated Symbol Classification: Distinguishes between ticks, half-ticks, and symbols that don't fit either category.
  * CNN Architecture: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network for efficient symbol recognition.
  * PDF Integration: Extracts symbols directly from PDF files for processing.
  * Component of MAAT: Serves as one of the building blocks for the Mobile Assessment and Annotation Tool.
